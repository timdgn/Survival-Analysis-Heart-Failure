# Survival Analysis - Heart Failure

### Introduction into the subject

Heart failure — sometimes known as congestive heart failure — occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should.
When this happens, blood often backs up, flows back and fluid can build up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath.
Certain heart conditions, such as narrowed arteries in the heart (coronary artery disease) or high blood pressure, gradually leave the heart too weak or too stiff to fill and pump blood properly, and can lead to heart failure.

Heart failure is a serious condition with high prevalence (about 2% in the adult population in developed countries, and more than 8% in patients older than 75 years). The cost for society is high, reaching up to 2% of total healthcare expenditure in developed countries. Hence the importance of being able to analyse and predict what factors are more likely to shorten the duration of life after heart failure is diagnosed.
